In regexes, explain the difference between “greedy” and “non-greedy” quantifiers; particularly how they choose their stopping condition.

A greedy quantifier (`*`, `+`, `?`, `{m,n}`) grabs as many characters as it can on its first pass, then backs off one character at a time only if the rest of the pattern fails to match. Its stopping condition is therefore “no more characters can be given back and still satisfy the overall pattern.” In effect it asks, “How far can I push the cursor to the right and still succeed?”

A non-greedy (lazy or reluctant) quantifier (`*?`, `+?`, `??`, `{m,n}?`) does the mirror image. It starts by taking the minimum it is allowed—just enough to satisfy its own lower bound—then grows one character at a time only if the remainder of the pattern fails. Its stopping condition is “the earliest point at which the rest of the pattern succeeds.” It asks, “What is the first place I can stop and still succeed?”

Consider the text `<b>bold</b>` and the pattern `<.*>`.

*Greedy* `.*` eats everything up to the final `>`, so the match is `<b>bold</b>`.
*Non-greedy* `.*?` stops at the first `>` that lets the whole pattern succeed, matching `<b>`.

Both quantifiers rely on the same backtracking engine; they simply begin the search from opposite ends of the allowable range and walk toward the other end until success is possible.

You:

So if I am implementing a “repeat” operator in a regex-like DSL, in addition to specifying the pattern it matches and its n,m cardinality,I need it to have a “greedy” flag?

ChatGPT:

Thought for 5 seconds

Yes. Cardinality alone (`min … max`) says only how many repeats are allowed. Greediness (or laziness) says **in what order to try those counts** when the engine explores its search space. A practical data structure therefore needs at least three fields:

```lua
pattern to repeat
min_reps
max_reps   // often ∞
greedy     // true → try max→min, false → try min→max
```

In a backtracking VM you simply loop over the candidate repeat counts in the chosen order, pushing the engine state for each attempt. With a Thompson-style NFA you insert ε-transitions for “take another copy” and “proceed,” then rank the transitions so the greedy branch is consulted first (or last, for lazy). Either way, the boolean (or an enum if you also support possessive quantifiers) is essential if you want both behaviors exposed in your DSL; without it you’re hard-coding one policy.

You:

Can a `repeat` pattern matcher decide by itself whether it has reached its end condition, or does it need to be embedded in an engine that has a larger view of the sequence in which the `repeat` matcher is embedded?

ChatGPT:

Thought for 8 seconds

A repeat node can’t know on its own when to stop, because its correct stopping point is defined **by whatever comes next in the pattern**. Greedy or lazy, it must hand the engine a series of “candidate endpoints” and wait to be told which one lets the rest of the pattern succeed.

---

### Why the quantifier can’t decide in isolation

-   **Greedy case** – The quantifier tries the largest span first, but it stops backing off only when *the following sub-expression* finally matches.

-   **Lazy case** – The quantifier offers the smallest span first, but it keeps growing only until *the following sub-expression* matches.


Either way the repeat node can’t tell, by inspecting just the characters it has consumed, whether more or fewer repeats are needed; it needs feedback from the next part of the regex.

---

### What this means for an implementation

1.  **Backtracking engines (PCRE-style).**
    The repeat node is just a loop that pushes successive engine states (`pos, rep_count`) in the order dictated by its greediness flag. The overall engine pops those states while trying the rest of the pattern. Only the engine—as the global orchestrator—knows when a given state yields a full match.

2.  **Thompson-NFA engines (Rust’s `regex`, RE2, etc.).**
    At compile time the quantifier is expanded into ε-transitions: one edge that stays in the loop, one that proceeds. Run-time matching is then just NFA traversal, but that traversal includes states produced by the *entire* pattern, so the decision is still global—just implicit in the state machine.

3.  **DFA compilation.**
    The whole pattern (including the repeat) is determinized into a big automaton. At run time each input character drives a single state transition, so there’s no explicit “decision” inside the repeat node. But that’s only because the repeat was already fused with what comes after it during determinization—the broader view happened earlier.

4.  **Parser-combinator or PEG style.**
    Same story: the combinator for `repeat` yields matches in an order (max-to-min or min-to-max). The enclosing sequence combinator attempts the rest; only that outer context can accept or reject each attempt.


---

### Exception: possessive quantifiers

A **possessive** quantifier (`*+`, `++`, `{m,n}+` in PCRE/Java) *does* decide unilaterally: it consumes as much as it can and refuses to backtrack. That works only because its contract is “never give characters back.”

---

**Bottom line:** a normal (backtracking) repeat operator must be embedded in, or compiled together with, an engine that has visibility beyond the repeated sub-pattern. Only the overall engine can say, “This endpoint is the one that lets the whole pattern succeed.”

You:

Can a repeat matcher operate correctly if it is given the “terminator pattern,” I.e., the pattern which would be next in the sequence of which the `repeat` matcher is the predecessor?

ChatGPT:

Thought for 11 seconds

It can solve some—but not all—of the stopping problem.

Give the repeat node a reference to the pattern that follows it (“the terminator”), and it can run an inner loop:

1.  Consume according to its min/max and greediness.

2.  At each candidate endpoint, hand control to that terminator matcher.

3.  If the terminator matches, stop; otherwise continue (back-off for greedy, grow for lazy).


That is enough for straightforward tails such as a fixed string or a simple sub-regex. It is how many engines optimise something like `.*?END`: the `.*?` node keeps jumping to the next occurrence of `E`, then asks “does `ND` match here?” No global engine is needed beyond that handshake.

But the moment the tail itself contains branching, back-references, look-arounds, or further quantifiers, the repeat node can no longer be sure the terminator’s success really means “the whole rest of the pattern will succeed.” Example:

```less
a* ( b  |  ac )
```

If the text is `aaac`, the terminator seen by `a*` is `(b|ac)`. The first time `ac` matches, the overall pattern succeeds; the first time `b` matches, it fails. The repeat node would have to explore both branches of the alternation to know which outcome matters—effectively re-implementing the regex VM inside itself. At that point you have reinvented the central engine.

So in practice:

-   **Yes** – passing the next matcher lets a repeat node settle questions that depend only on that immediate tail, and it can be an efficient micro-optimisation.

-   **No** – for full regex semantics, you still need an orchestrator with visibility beyond the terminator, because later constructs can retroactively make the “correct” endpoint earlier or later than the terminator alone reveals.


The usual solution is what NFAs and backtracking VMs already do: compile the repeat and everything after it into a single graph of states, then let the generic engine explore that graph. That keeps each node simple while guaranteeing correctness for every construct the language allows.

Explain “NFA” and “VM” in this context.

ChatGPT:

Thought for 4 seconds

An **NFA engine** turns the regex into a nondeterministic finite-automaton graph: every node represents “where we are in the pattern,” and edges are labeled with either a literal character or ε (an empty move). At run time the engine keeps a set (often a bit-vector) of all states that could be active after each input character. Because all possibilities are advanced in lockstep, it never rewinds the text: worst-case time is linear in input length. Greedy vs. lazy is encoded by putting the ε edge that means “stay in the loop” before or after the ε edge that means “proceed,” so the subset construction naturally prefers one path over the other. Libraries like RE2 and Rust’s `regex` work this way.

A **VM engine** (backtracking virtual machine) compiles the pattern into a little bytecode—`MATCH_CHAR`, `JUMP`, `SPLIT`, `SAVE_POS`, etc.—and then interprets it with an explicit stack of backtrack frames. When a `SPLIT` is hit (e.g., at the mouth of a `*` loop or an alternation), the VM pushes the secondary branch and continues down the primary one. If that primary path fails later, it pops a frame and resumes from the saved program counter and input position. Greedy vs. lazy is just the order in which the two branch addresses are placed in the bytecode. This design handles captures, back-references, and look-arounds but can blow up exponentially on pathological input (the “Regex DoS”). Perl, PCRE, Java, and .NET use this style.

So, “NFA” here means “simulate all paths simultaneously with a state-set”; “VM” means “run a backtracking bytecode interpreter that explores paths one at a time.”

Is there an existing Rust crate that facilitates the construction of regex-like matching engines that can be used on my own structure with my own matcher? My structure is a tree and a match pattern may return more than one path through the tree.

ChatGPT:

Thought for 1m 14s

For arbitrary data structures you won’t find a “drop-in” analogue of `regex`—every Rust regex crate ultimately assumes a **linear `&[u8]` input**. The moment your “alphabet” is *paths through a tree* you leave that territory and have three realistic options:

**1\. Expose your own tree as a Tree-sitter grammar and use its query engine.**
`tree-sitter` compiles an S-expression query into an NFA that walks a concrete-syntax tree and returns *all* matches via a `QueryCursor`; a single pattern can therefore yield many distinct paths. The crate is pure Rust bindings, so you can drive it entirely inside your codebase and feed the cursor’s captures back into your application logic[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tree-sitter). The trade-off is that you must write a small grammar (or auto-generate one) that maps each of your node kinds to a Tree-sitter symbol, but once that’s done you get a robust, battle-tested matcher with lazy/greedy captures, predicates and naming.

**2\. Build a bespoke automaton on top of `tree-automata`.**
The `tree-automata` crate gives you bottom-up and alternating tree automata primitives in Rust[github.com](https://github.com/regular-pv/tree-automata). You define states and transition functions for each node kind; the library executes the automaton and tells you which states (i.e., which pattern alternatives) are reachable at every node. Because the data model is *trees* rather than byte streams, this is the closest conceptual match to “regex for trees,” but the API is low-level—you will have to translate your DSL’s `repeat/alternation/sequence` operators into explicit automaton states yourself.

**3\. Reuse the linear automata machinery and map your tree to a stream.**
`regex-automata` exposes the raw Thompson NFA, Pike VM and DFA builders that power Rust’s `regex` crate[github.com](https://github.com/BurntSushi/regex-automata). If you can linearise each root-to-leaf path into a token stream (e.g., encode node-type IDs into bytes) you can compile your DSL to that NFA and run it over every path. It’s fast, well-tested and supports non-greedy quantifiers, but you lose direct access to sibling/ancestor relationships unless you encode them into the stream.

---

**Reality check**

-   There is no off-the-shelf crate that lets you plug in “my matcher returns zero-or-more child paths” and automatically handles greedy/lazy backtracking.

-   The forum discussion on “generic regex” reached the same conclusion: once you leave byte strings you either adopt a parser-combinator or roll a custom automaton layer yourself[users.rust-lang.org](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/generic-regex/105546).


**Recommendation**

If you want something working this month, wrap your tree in a minimal Tree-sitter grammar and write your DSL as Tree-sitter queries. You’ll get multi-path matches, capture groups, a proven engine and zero concern about exponential blow-ups. When you eventually need deeper static guarantees or custom optimisation, use `tree-automata` as the foundation for a dedicated engine; its state-machine model maps cleanly to the semantics you’ve been designing.

You:

Will going the Tree-sitter route also handle captures and the like?

ChatGPT:

Thought for 30 seconds

Yes. Tree-sitter’s query language was designed around **named captures**, so when you move your DSL to Tree-sitter you get capture semantics “for free.”

-   In a pattern you mark any node you want to extract with an `@capture_name`, for example
    `(function_definition name:(identifier) @func)`.

-   At run-time you compile the S-expression patterns into a `Query`, create a `QueryCursor`, and stream either **matches** (groups of captures that satisfied one pattern) or the captures themselves. Each capture arrives as `(Node, capture_index)`; you can look the name up with `query.capture_names()` and turn the node into text with `node.utf8_text(bytes)`.


Rust sketch:

```rust
let query_src = r#"
  (call_expression
     function: (identifier) @func
     arguments: (argument_list (identifier) @arg)*)"#;

let query  = Query::new(my_lang(), query_src)?;
let mut qc = QueryCursor::new();

for m in qc.matches(&query, root_node, source.as_bytes()) {
    for cap in m.captures {
        let name = query.capture_names()[cap.index as usize];
        let text = cap.node.utf8_text(source.as_bytes())?;
        println!("{name}: {text}");
    }
}
```

The API also lets you inspect **capture quantifiers** (`query.capture_quantifiers`) and iterate over a flat stream of captures (`QueryCursor::captures`) when you don’t care which pattern matched first[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tree-sitter/latest/tree_sitter/struct.Query.html)[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tree-sitter/latest/tree_sitter/struct.QueryCursor.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Tree-sitter deliberately omits PCRE-style back-references, but for ordinary “grab this subtree (or these repeated subtrees) as a capture” it covers everything you need, without any extra plumbing on your side.
