//! Functions for traversing and manipulating the envelope hierarchy.
//!
//! This module provides functionality for traversing the hierarchical structure
//! of envelopes, allowing for operations such as inspection, transformation,
//! and extraction of specific elements. It implements a visitor pattern that
//! enables executing arbitrary code on each element of an envelope in a
//! structured way.
//!
//! The traversal can be performed in two modes:
//! - Structure-based traversal: Visits every element in the envelope hierarchy
//! - Tree-based traversal: Skips node elements and focuses on the semantic
//!   content
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use std::{cell::RefCell, collections::HashSet};
//!
//! use bc_envelope::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Create an envelope with nested structure
//! let envelope = Envelope::new("Alice")
//!     .add_assertion("knows", "Bob")
//!     .add_assertion("email", "alice@example.com");
//!
//! // Collect all digests in the envelope by walking its structure
//! let digests = RefCell::new(HashSet::new());
//! let visitor = |env: &Envelope,
//!                _level: usize,
//!                _edge: EdgeType,
//!                state: ()|
//!  -> ((), bool) {
//!     digests.borrow_mut().insert(env.digest().into_owned());
//!     (state, false)
//! };
//!
//! // Walk the entire envelope structure
//! envelope.walk(false, (), &visitor);
//!
//! // All elements of the envelope will have their digests collected
//! assert!(digests.borrow().len() > 0);
//! ```
